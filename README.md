## Assessment

Dear Engineer,

This assessment consists of developing a simple game somehow similar to minesweeper. The rules are defined below.

-   The game starts on a 6 x 6 board with hidden tiles :done:
-   The 36 tiles are randomly assigned a value :done:
    -   12 tiles are assigned smileys (:smiley:) :done:
    -   12 tiles are assigned bombs (:boom:) :done:
    -   12 tiles are assigned resets (:cyclone:) :done:
-   The player can then flip one tile at a time, revealing its type :done:
-   The player wins when flipping **3 consecutive smileys** :tada: :done:
-   The player looses when flipping **2 consecutive bombs** :done:
-   Flipping a reset will **reset** the number of consecutive **smileys and bombs to 0** :done:
    -   additionally, a reset will also display the **number of bombs and smileys in its 8 surrounding tiles** _(optional)_:50%:

## Functional requirements

-   The game state should be persisted when reloading the page :done: redux-toolkit
    -   preferably use a state management library to handle the state of the game :done:
-   There should be a button to restart the game :done:
-   A score containing number of wins and losses should be kept in local storage _(optional)_:done:

## Evaluation

The game should be implemented using `React` and you will be evaluated on the following aspects:

-   Readability and maintainability of your code
-   Unit tests
-   End to End tests _(optional)_

Feel free to ask questions any time and use any libraries or tools that you might need.

**Good luck! :+1:**

## Misc

Here are some `HTML` and `css/scss` snippets you might want to use to save time

`index.html`

```html
<body>
    <main>
        <!-- 3 x 3 -->
        <section class="board-3x3">
            <div></div>
            <div>💥</div>
            <div>🌀</div>
            <div>😃</div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
        </section>
    </main>
</body>
```

`styles.scss`

```scss
body {
    padding: 1rem;
    margin: 0;
    background-color: #b762ff;
    background-image: linear-gradient(160deg, #b762ff, #0079ff, #ff0, #ff576f);
}

main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: #698ef9;
    border: 1rem solid #000;
    min-height: calc(100vh - 4rem);
}

.board-3x3 {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
    grid-gap: 5px;
    margin: 1rem;

    & > * {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
        font-size: 2.5rem;
        background-color: #fbeee0;
        border-radius: 5%;
